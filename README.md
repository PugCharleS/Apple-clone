## Cart

In this section you can view the products that you have added to your cart later.
Here you can delete a product or all the products, just as you can make the purchase which will require you to enter your information in the form, the form has a small data validation system, so you will not be able to evade it so easily, later When filling out the form, you will be able to make your purchase and you will see the ID of your purchase on another screen.
